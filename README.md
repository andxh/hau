##Description
http://haujournal.org is a wonderful open-access anthro journal. I wanted to spend my afternoon reading it. Instead, I built this quick app.

##What it does  
The app scrapes various pages of the website and caches the results.  
The navigation structure generally mimics that of the website.  
PDFs can be sent to other apps (e.g. email, :x:note, etc.).

##TODO:  

- Wire Current to show the latest issue
- Callbacks for updating the view once downloading an issue is complete
- "Loading" indicators
- Design table cells to reflect author, pages ("make it look like the journal")
- Landscape orientation
- iPhone views
- Some kind of simple note taking ability
