##Description
http://haujournal.org is a wonderful open-access anthro journal. I wanted to spend my afternoon reading it. Instead, I built this quick app.

##What it does  
The app scrapes various pages of the website and caches the results.  
The navigation structure generally mimics that of the website.  
PDFs can be sent to other apps (e.g. email, :x:note, etc.).
